Status combines pseudonymous privacy-focused messenger and secure crypto wallet into one powerful communication tool. Chat with friends and growing communities. Buy, store, and exchange digital assets.

Status is your Ethereum operating system.

SECURE ETHEREUM WALLET
The Status crypto wallet allows you to securely send, store, and exchange Ethereum assets such as ETH, SNT, stable coins such as DAI, as well as collectibles. Confidently take control of your cryptocurrency and digital assets with our multichain Ethereum wallet app, supporting mainnet, Arbitrum, and Optimism. The Status blockchain wallet currently only supports ETH, ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 assets; it does not support Bitcoin.

PRIVATE MESSENGER
Send private 1:1 and private group chats without anyone snooping on your communications. Status is a messenger app that eliminates centralised message relays for greater privacy and secure messaging. All messages are encrypted with end-to-end encryption. Additionally, no message exposes who the author or the intended recipient is, so nobody, not even Status, knows who is talking to who or what was said.

EARN WITH DEFI
Put your crypto to work with the latest decentralised finance apps and decentralised exchanges (DEX) such as Maker, Aave, Uniswap, Synthetix, PoolTogether, Zerion, Kyber, and more.

CONNECT WITH YOUR COMMUNITY
Explore, connect, and chat with your favourite communities and friends. Whether it is a small group of friends, an artist collective, crypto traders, or the next big organization - text and communicate with Status communities.

PRIVATE ACCOUNT CREATION
Stay private with pseudo-anonymous account creation. When creating your free account, you will NEVER have to enter a phone number, email address, or bank account. Your wallet private keys are locally generated and securely stored to ensure only you have access to your funds and financial transactions.
